# Vibe Coding MCP

A modern web application that demonstrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced user experiences. This project showcases how to create vibrant, responsive interfaces that adapt to user context and preferences.

## Features

- Interactive UI with smooth animations
- Context-aware components that adapt to user behavior
- Theme switching based on user preferences
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Demonstration of MCP principles in action

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an approach to designing applications that are aware of their context and can adapt accordingly. This includes understanding user preferences, device capabilities, and interaction patterns to provide a more personalized and intuitive experience.

## How to Use This Demo

1. Interact with the cards to see how they adapt to your behavior
2. Open the settings panel to adjust your preferences
3. Resize your browser window to see responsive adaptations
4. Notice how the UI elements adapt to your interactions over time

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Framer Motion
- Styled Components

## Learn More

This project demonstrates how to implement the Model Context Protocol pattern in a React application. The key concepts include:

1. **Context Awareness**: The application is aware of its environment and user preferences
2. **Adaptive UI**: Components adapt based on context and user interactions
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features are progressively revealed as users interact with the application
4. **Accessibility**: Preferences for reduced motion and high contrast are respected
